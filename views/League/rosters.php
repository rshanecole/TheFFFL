      <div class="panel-body">
      	<h5><strong>Active Roster</strong></h5>
        <ul class="list-group">
          <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Definition:</strong> All rosters will consist of 16 active players with eight players in the starting lineup and an eight player bench. </li>
          <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Restrictions:</strong> Rosters must include no more than 16 active players by 8 p.m. the Tuesday before the first NFL game of the season. Any team exceeding that limit after the deadline will have players removed from its roster beginning with the most recent acquisition until the roster meets the 16 player limit.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5><strong>Inactive Roster</strong></h5>
        <ul class="list-group">
          <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Definition:</strong> Each roster will have two optional inactive positions. They will consist of the Physically Unable to Perform (PUP) list and Practice Squad (PS). The benefit of both positions is that they allow the team to designate the players as franchise players at a reduced cost. Inactive players may not be traded. When eligible for activation, the player may be activated. However, if this is done before the next season’s franchise deadline, the player’s salary will increase as usual. Only players on the active roster may be signed to an inactive roster position.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Physically Unable to Perform (PUP):</strong> Each team is allowed only one player on the PUP list. To be placed on the PUP list, the player must have an injury that appears on the injury report provided by CBS Sports. The injury must be disclosed and does not include suspensions or non-football injuries. Players may be placed on the PUP list during the preseason activities and regular season only. When a player is eligible for the PUP list, a red cross will appear by his name on the team page. When placed on the PUP list, the player will remain there for at least eight regular season weeks and will be unavailable to the team during that period.  Adding of a player to the PUP list can be undone until the team acquires another player in free agency, the player plays a game, or by Sunday morning at 9 a.m. If a player is released, that player will not be returned to the team's roster. Another player may be acquired to fill the empty roster spot. If the player cannot complete the minimum eight weeks on the PUP list during the season in which he was placed on the PUP list, then the remainer of the eight weeks must be completed during the next season, only if the team decides to keep the player.  If the player has not completed his eight weeks by the end of the regular season and the team does not designate him as a franchise player by the franchise designation deadline for the following season, then the player will be released from the team at the franchise deadline.

After the eight regular season weeks, the team has three options.  One option is the team may release the player without having to first activate the player.  A second option is to place him back into the active roster, in which case his salary would increase as usual.  The third option is to keep the player on the PUP list for the rest of the season.  The benefit to this option is that should the team choose to keep the player for the next season, the team can do so without the player's cap value being increased. To do this the player must remain on the PUP list through the remainder of the season until the next franchise deadline.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Practice Squad (PS):</strong> This optional inactive roster position allows NFL rookies to be placed on reserve. A team can keep the player the following season with no increase in cap value. Players may only be placed on the PS during their NFL rookie season. A player may not be signed to the PS until after the FFFL draft and must be signed to the PS before the roster deadline for the second week of games. Once signed to the Practice Squad (PS), the player can not be released or activated until the conclusion of the season. If, during the offseason, a team chooses to activate the player, the player’s salary will increase as usual. If a player on the PS is designated as a franchise player prior to his sophomore season, he will be automatically activated at the franchise deadline.</li>

        <h3 class="panel-title text-center"><strong>Starting Lineups</strong></h3>
      </div>
      <div class="panel-body">
        <ul class="list-group">
          <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Definition:</strong> A starting lineup consists of one QB, one RB, one RB/WR, two WRs, one WR/TE, one TE and one K. </li>
          <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Deadlines and Substitutes:</strong> The deadline for adding to or removing a player from a starting lineup will be the scheduled kickoff time for that player, unless the player's scheduled kickoff is Sunday between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. central. For players kicking off during that time who are ruled inactive after 9 a.m., a substitute will be automatically inserted into the starting lineup in place of the inactive player. Substitutes must not kickoff until after 9 a.m. Substitutes will be determined by a predefined listing of players on the team's roster through the league website.  Substitutes may also be designated for Sunday night games if the owner emails the requested substitute to the commissioner before kickoff. </li>
          <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Restrictions:</strong> Any trade or free agent acquisition completed after a player's scheduled kickoff, may not be used in that week's game. Teams should never leave a player whose team has an open date in the starting lineup unless an adequate rationale is presented to the commissioner prior to the final FA Draft of the week.
