        <ul class="list-group">
          <li class="list-group-item">The FFFL began in 1998 with 30 teams. Today it is a highly competitive, keeper-style league of 20 teams. The league consists of two conferences of 10 teams each, each divided into two divisions of five teams. Each team plays a 13 week regular season schedule in which it plays the other teams in its division twice, three conference teams in the other division, and one team from each of the divisions in the other conference.  A three round playoff takes place at the conclusion of the regular season with the championship game during the NFL's 16th week.</li>

      </div>
      <div class="panel-body">
        <ul class="list-group">
			<li class="list-group-item"><strong>Clones:</strong> Because there will be more than one draft, there is the possibility of some players being acquired by more than one team.  When this happens, the player will have been "cloned." Players can only be cloned when they are drafted in more than one draft or if two teams acquire them through free agency. Despite the existence of "clones," a player may be drafted only once during an individual draft.</li>
        	<li class="list-group-item"><strong>Franchise Players:</strong> Before the drafts, owners will be able to designate players on their roster from the previous year as "franchise" players to reserve the player for that team for the next season. A salary cap of 100 million will regulate franchise players.  Any player that was designated a franchise player by only one team will be available for drafting, however the player will carry with him a salary equal to the salary paid him by the franchising team plus 10 million.</li>
			<li class="list-group-item"><strong>Draft:</strong> Before the season starts, players will be acquired by each team through a draft to fill out their 16 player rosters.  There will be two 10 round drafts. Players franchised by only one team will be available in a supplemental draft prior to and after the league drafts.</li>
        	<li class="list-group-item"><strong>Free Agency:</strong> Free agents are any players that are not currently on two.  All free agents will be available to all teams in the league.  They will be acquired through a weekly FA draft system and open free agency between Friday's draft and Sunday morning's 9 a.m. roster deadline.</li>
			<li class="list-group-item"><strong>Trades:</strong> Players may be traded to other teams in the league during the season before the trade deadline and almost three weeks before the franchise deadline during the OTA, Mini-camp and Training Camp periods. Multiple player trades are allowed. Teams may also trade draft picks from rounds 1-7.</li>
        	<li class="list-group-item"><strong>Inactive Roster Positions:</strong> There are two inactive positions: Physically Unable to Perform (PUP) and Practice Squad (PS).  Both are optional positions.   Each team is allowed only one PUP and one PS slot. If a player is moved to the PUP list, the player will remain there for a total of eight regular season weeks and will be unavailable to the team during that time, but if the team chooses to keep the player for the next season, the team can do so without the player's cap value being increased.  The PS position gives teams the ability to keep NFL rookies the next season without an increase in salary.  Once placed on the PS, the player is unavailable to the team for the entire season.</li>
			<li class="list-group-item"><strong>Rosters and Starting Lineups:</strong> Starting lineups may be adjusted at anytime before a player's kickoff or by 9 a.m. Sunday for kickoff times between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m.</li>
        	<li class="list-group-item"><strong>Games:</strong> Every week each team will compete head-to-head with another team. Win-loss records will determine standings and berths into the playoffs at the end of the season. Only starting line ups will be used in the games for scoring.</li>
			<li class="list-group-item"><strong>Scoring:</strong> Each player will accumulate weekly points based on their yards from scrimmage and touchdowns, fgs and pats scored in their NFL game.</li>
        	<li class="list-group-item"><strong>Playoffs:</strong> Eight teams will participate in the playoffs after the regular season. The winners of each division will automatically qualify. The remaining playoff berths will be filled with two wildcards per conference based on overall record and total points scored</li>
